### Hi there 👋 

My name is a Alyssa!

I'm a Full Stack Developer, sometimes 🧜‍♀️, sometimes musician 🎶, <Yogi /> and overall a passionate joy/sunshine bringer.

I'm looking to make the world a better place by sharing my passion, joys, and synergizing that into web apps that will improve our lives.
